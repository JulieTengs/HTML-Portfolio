    <h3>Interstellar</h3>
    <p>My favorite movie of all time. The depth of the teories is just amazing. I love space, theories about time and everyhting else unknown.</p>
    <h3>End Game</h3>
    <p>Please see all other marvel movies released before this one before watching it. The characters stories coming to an end, the easter eggs, the shocks, the feelings. Just a marvelous movie.</p>
    <h3>Spirit: Stallion of the Cimarron</h3>
    <p>I have seen this movie so many times, also as a grown up. Great movie.</p>
